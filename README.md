## Cool Features:
### Auto Align and Shoot
Using a Limelight and Distance sensors we can line up and shoot power cells accurately.
### Intake Indexing
Using a beambreak sensor we can count how many power cells we have picked up. We can also use the beam break sensor to space the cells appropriately to ensure minimal jams.
